# Prodigy_ML_01

## House Prices Prediction Project

## Overview:
This is the repo for my first task at the ML Virtual Internship from [Prodigy InfoTech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/prodigy-infotech/). It's about applying advanced ML techniques to predict house price.

## Key Features:
- Data Exploration: Explored the dataset, identifying patterns and insights.
- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, applied log transformation, and encoded categorical variables.
- Model Training: Utilized Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models.
- Model Evaluation: Employed root mean squared error (RMSE) to assess model performance.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized the Ridge Regression model using GridSearchCV.
- Predicting test data.
